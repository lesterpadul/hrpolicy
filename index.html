<h1>HR POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL</h1>

<!-- Introduction -->
<div class="box-bottom">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Azaza Human Resources Policy and Procedure Manual provides the policies and procedures for managing and developing staff. It also provides guidelines Azaza will use to administer these policies, with the correct procedure to follow.</p>
<p>Azaza Inc. will keep HR policies current and relevant. Therefore, from time to time it will be necessary to modify and amend some sections of the policies and procedures, or to add new procedures.</p>
<p>Any suggestions, recommendations or feedback on the policies and procedures specified in this manual are welcome.</p>
<p>These policies and procedures apply to <strong>ALL</strong> employees.</p>
<h3>Azaza Biz Solutions, Inc.<br>
(AZAZA, Inc.)</h3>
</div>

<hr id="pc">
<!-- PERSONAL CONDUCT -->
<div class="box-bottom">
<h2>PERSONAL CONDUCT</h2>
<div id="accordion1">
<h3>General policy on personal conduct</h3>
<div>
<p>Maintaining a professional, business like appearance is very important to the success of Azaza Inc.  The company expects its employees to maintain a high standard of conduct and work performance to make sure the business maintains its good reputation with customers and suppliers. Good personal conduct contributes to a good work environment for all.</p>
<p>This involves all employees:
<ul><li>observing all policies and procedures</li>
<li>treating colleagues with courtesy and respect</li>
<li>treating customers and clients in a professional manner at all times</li></ul></p>
</div>

<h3>Attendance policy</h3>
<div>
<p>Your regular attendance at work and punctuality are important factors to your success personally and to the success of our organization as a whole. We all work as a team to provide services to our affiliates and clients, and this requires that each person be at work at the assigned times.</p>
<p>Azaza Inc. has a standard workweek of Monday to Friday. The operational hours are generally between 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. for Monday to Friday and 8:30am to 1:30pm for Saturday (this may be varied depending on the company's operational needs) with one hour allotted for an unpaid lunch break. 
<ul>
<li>Employees receive (2) two fifteen-minute breaks one in the morning and second in the afternoon.</li>
<li>Lunch break is between 12 noon to 1:00 pm.</li></ul></p>
<p>Variations to these hour provisions are sometimes desired or are required and Azaza reserves the right to request employees to start and finish at different times than those noted above.</p>
<p>Employees are expected to report and be prepared to work at the set times. If a situation arises which makes it impossible to report to work, or if you are going to be late, you must immediately contact your appropriate supervisor. If a pattern of tardiness and/or absenteeism arises the employee will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge.</p>
</div>

<h3>Overtime policy</h3>
<div>
<p>1. Normal hours of work vary between are 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. for Monday to Friday, including a one (1) hour unpaid lunch break.  Regular working hours may vary from the above, with the approval of Azaza Management.</p>
<p>2. No overtime shall be planned or worked by support staff unless approved by his or her supervisor.</p>
</div>

<h3>Smoking policy</h3>
<div>
<p>Azaza Inc. has a non-smoking policy. Smoking is not permitted on Azaza property or in offices at any time.</p>
<p>Smokers who need to take breaks should do so in their allotted breaks (no more than 1 per day in addition to their lunch break). These breaks must be limited to 10 minutes from leaving the workplace to recommencing work. These breaks must not be taken at the entrance to Azaza offices. Excessive smoking breaks will be regarded as absenteeism and performance improvement action may be taken.</p>
</div>

<h3>Alcohol & drugs policy</h3>
<div>
<p>Azaza Inc. is concerned by factors affecting an employee's ability to safely and effectively do their work to a satisfactory standard. The business recognises alcohol or other drug abuse can impair short-term or long-term work performance and is an occupational health and safety risk.</p>
<p>Azaza Inc. will do its utmost to create and maintain a safe, healthy and productive workplace for all employees. Azaza has a zero tolerance policy in regards to the use of illicit drugs on their premises or the attending of other business related premises (e.g. clients) while under the influence of illicit drugs. Contravening either of these points may lead to instant dismissal.</p>
<p>Azaza Inc. does not tolerate attending work under the influence of alcohol. This may result in performance improvement action or dismissal.</p>
<p>Azaza, at times, makes alcohol available to staff over the age of 18. Limiting the consumption of any alcohol made available is the responsibility of the employee. Driving over the legal limit or under the influence of illicit drugs is illegal.</p>
</div>

<h3>Dress code policy</h3>
<div>
<p>Azaza recognises that, like most companies, all employees act as representatives of the organisation and should therefore be dressed accordingly.  Regardless of the employee's interaction with clients, customers, suppliers, or contractors, each employee projects the reputation of the company.  Part of this impression depends on each employee's choice of dress.  For this reason, you are asked to be aware of presentation of yourself and to adhere to the dress code policy at all times when on company premises or when representing Azaza.</p>
<p>As a minimum standard, dress should be clean, neat and professional.  Azaza has chosen to offer a smart casual dress environment for employees.</p>
<p><h4>Inappropriate Attire</h4>
The following should be taken into consideration when defining what is regarded as inappropriate clothing for the workplace:
<ul>
<li>slogans or pictures on t-shirts/tops containing nudity or foul language, may be deemed sexually offensive, and would not be appropriate</li>
<li>revealing attire i.e. shorts (hot-pants/cut-off jeans/sports shorts are not acceptable), crop tops, clothes made of see-through materials, and clothes that expose areas of the body usually covered in the workplace, may be deemed sexually offensive, and would not be appropriate</li>
<li>ripped, frayed or disheveled clothing, athletic wear, tight, revealing or otherwise inappropriate clothing</li>
<li>slippers are considered inappropriate for the workplace</li>
<li>an observable lack of underwear, may be deemed sexually offensive, and would not be appropriate</li>
<li>facial jewelry, such as eyebrow rings, nose rings, lip rings, and tongue studs, is not professionally appropriate and must not be worn during business hours</li>
<li>torso body piercings with visible jewelry or jewelry that can be seen through or under clothing must not be worn during business hours</li></ul></p>
<p>The above are just a few examples of what would be regarded as inappropriate attire for the workplace; however employees are reminded that if they have any doubts in their own mind as to whether an article of clothing is appropriate, then it is likely that others will share this doubt and may be offended, and the article of clothing should therefore not be worn.  Regardless of dress and grooming, all staff must carry or wear the Azaza identification card at all times while at work.</p>
<p>Employees are expected to use good judgement and to show courtesy to their co-workers, employers and clients by dressing in a manner that is presentable.  The company reserves the right to request an employee to dress to an appropriate standard.  Acceptable personal appearance, including proper maintenance of work areas, is an ongoing requirement of employment with Azaza Inc. At all times employees are asked to be cognizant that regardless of their interaction with clients, customers, suppliers, contractors, or volunteers Azaza Inc. is still a place of business.</p>
<p><h4>Breach of Policy</h4>
Any staff member who does not meet the attire or grooming standards set the Azaza Inc. will be required to take corrective action, for example leaving the premises to change clothing.  Repeated disregard for the dress policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge.</p>
<p>If you have a question about whether something is appropriate or inappropriate, please check with your direct supervisor/manager.</p>

<li><h4>Disclaimer and/or Signature</h4>
All emails sent must include the approved business disclaimer and/or signature.</li> 
<li><h4>Employees Have No Reasonable Expectation of Privacy</h4>
E-mail messages created and transmitted on Azaza computers are the property of the company.  Azaza Inc. reserves the right to monitor all e-mail transmitted via the company's computer system.  Employees have no reasonable expectation of privacy when it comes to the use of Azaza's e-mail system.</li>
<li><h4>Email Monitoring Activities</h4>
The company reserves the right to monitor, inspect, copy, review and store any and all employee e-mail use at any time and without prior notice.  In addition, Azaza may monitor, inspect copy, review and store any files, information, software and other content created, sent, received, downloaded, uploaded, accessed, or stored through the company's e-mail system.  Azaza reserves the right to disclose e-mail information and images to regulators, courts, law enforcement agencies, and other third parties without the employee's consent.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
To protect Azaza Inc. from the potential effects of the misuse and abuse of email, the following instructions are for all users.
<ol>
<li>No material is to be sent as email that is defamatory, in breach of copyright or business confidentiality, or prejudicial to the good standing of Azaza Inc. in the community or to its relationship with staff, customers, suppliers and any other person or business with whom it has a relationship.</li>

</p>
<p><h4>Breach of Policy</h4>
These guidelines are intended to provide Azaza employees with general examples of acceptable and unacceptable uses of the company's e-mail system. A violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>
</div>

<h3>Internet use policy</h3>
<div>
<p>Internet use, on company time, is authorized to conduct company business only.  Internet use brings the possibility of breaches to the security of confidential information.  Internet use also creates the possibility of contamination to our system via viruses or spyware.  Spyware allows unauthorized people, outside the company, potential access to company passwords and confidential other information.</p>
<p>Removing such programs from our Azaza Network requires IT staff to invest time and attention that is better devoted to progress.  For this reason, and to assure the use of work time appropriately for work, we ask staff members to limit Internet use.</p>
<p>Additionally, under no circumstances may Azaza computers or other electronic equipment be used to obtain, view, or reach any pornographic, or otherwise immoral, unethical, or non-business related Internet sites.  Management reserves the right to access the system to check if private use is excessive or inappropriate. Failure to comply will be taken as an offence and will be subject to appropriate investigation.   This may lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.</p>
</div>

<h3>Software Access Policy</h3>
<div>
<p>Software needed, in addition to the Microsoft Office and Adobe suite of products, must be authorized by Management and downloaded by the IT staff. If you need access to software, not currently on the Company network, talk with your direct Superior or Management and consult with our IT staff.</p>
</div>

<!-- RECRUITMENT -->
<div class="box-bottom">
<h2>RECRUITMENT</h2>
<div id="accordion2">
<h3>Policy</h3>
<div>
<p>Effective recruitment and selection is central and crucial to the successful functioning of Azaza.  It depends on finding people with the necessary skills, expertise and qualifications to deliver the Company's strategic objectives and the ability to make a positive contribution to the core values and aims of the organisation.</p>
</div>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<div>
<ol><li><h4>Job description and person specification</h4>
<p>The organisation will draft a job description and person specification for each role, which will be used during the selection process.</p>
<p>The job description will describe the overall responsibilities of the role and the key tasks involved in doing the job. Each job description will state that the organisation reserves the right to request an employee to be flexible in his or her duties when the business need requires it.</p>
<p>The person specification will identify the personal attributes that the job holder must possess in order to be capable of performing the job to a high standard. The person specification will include the qualifications necessary for the job, skills, personal attributes and experience.</p></li>
<li><h4>Advertising</h4>
<p>The organisation retains the right to advertise all positions both internally and externally.  Azaza is keen to facilitate internal promotions wherever possible as development opportunities for its staff.   Azaza Inc. may, on occasions, decide to restrict advertisement to internal candidates only. Furthermore junior posts will always be advertised internally in the first instance, to provide continuous development of existing members of staff unless the Management team agrees that this is not appropriate due to the specialist skills required for the post involved.</p>
<p>It is essential that advertisements for all vacancies are impartial and objective. All advertisements will use a number of media in order to allow all potential candidates to have an equal opportunity to apply for the vacancy. Advertising refers to advertising in newspapers, on websites, noticeboards, television, radio, and in magazines, etc.</p></li>
<li><h4>Application forms</h4>
<p>Application forms will be freely available to any person who wishes to apply for a vacancy. All advertisements will include instructions on the application procedure and how interested parties may apply. </p></li>
<li><h4>Shortlisting and assessment</h4>
<p>During the shortlisting, all applicants will be screened to identify the candidates who will be called for the next stage of the process. When selecting candidates to be shortlisted, the criteria set out in the person specification will be used. The organisation aims to ensure that all selection for shortlisting will be free from any discrimination and that each application will be dealt with on its merits.</p>
<p>For certain roles, the organisation may use practical testing to support the shortlisting process.</p></li>
<li><h4>References</h4>
<p>Applicants will be required to supply the names and addresses of three to five people from whom references can be obtained, one of which should normally be the applicant's current or most recent employer.  Only references for short listed candidates for interview will be obtained. References will normally be sought prior to interview, unless the candidate indicates otherwise.</p>
<p>All candidates will be asked to declare on the application form whether they have ever been convicted of any criminal offence and will also be required to declare if they are related to any member of staff within the Company.</p>
<p>All completed applications forms are private and confidential and should only be made available to those directly involved in the recruitment and selection process.</p></li>
<li><h4>Interview</h4>
<p>Not all applicants will be called for interview. The organisation aims to ensure an interview process that is free from discrimination. The interview panel will usually comprise a member of the HR team, a member of the management team, and other relevant persons as necessary. The selection of persons who sit on the interview panel is at the discretion of the company. All questions posed to the candidates will be consistent and will relate directly to the person's ability to do the job.</p>
<p>At the end of the interview each member of the interview board will compare the attributes of the candidates against specific criteria laid down in the job description, personal specification and company core values. Fair and proper procedures will be followed. The reasons for non-selection will be identified.</p></li>
<li><h4>Job Offer</h4>
<p>Give the successful candidate a letter of appointment setting out clear terms and conditions. This includes the nature of employment e.g. permanent, project based, or campaign based. The letter should include a welcome note and start details.</p>
<p>Once the candidate has accepted, feedback will be given to unsuccessful candidates as a matter of courtesy.</p></li>
<li><h4>Pre-employment</h4>
<p>Candidates may be requested to attend a pre-employment medical with the company doctor and submit their current NBI clearance to HR.</p></li></ol>

<h2>TRAINING</h2>
<div id="accordion4">
<h3>Policy</h3>
<div>
<p>Azaza Inc. is committed to the continuous development of its staff, in the same ways as we continuously develop our services.  This will be achieved by helping all staff identify and meet their own job and business-related development needs.  This will ensure that we have the adaptability and flexibility to thrive and succeed as a business.  Our business believes training is a two-way process. We encourage employees to participate and to highlight any gaps in their own skills or knowledge they believe they have. </p>
<p>To do this, Management, through the Performance Review process, will:
<ul><li>Ensure that staff have a level of knowledge and skill to fully perform their role</li>
<li>Encourage staff to develop within their current role</li>
<li>Look for potential, and find ways for staff to demonstrate potential</li>
<li>Recognise and reward staff development (utilising it wherever possible) and create a learning culture by providing opportunities for learning</li></ul>
</p>
<p>We recognise that the training and development of our staff is fundamental to the improvement of our operational performance and the achievement of our goals and core values.  Azaza Inc. will strive to make training and development an integral part of our operations and to follow a continuous process of appraisal, training and development.</p>

<!-- PROBATION -->
<div class="box-bottom">
<h2>PROBATION</h2>
<div id="accordion5">
<h3>Policy</h3>
<div>
<p>Azaza recognizes that new employees will need a period of time to become familiar with the company and to move toward competency in their position. The first few months of employment represent an opportunity for both the employee and the company to determine that both the business and the employee are satisfied the role is being performed satisfactorily and that the original hiring decision was best for all involved.</p>
<p>This policy applies to all employees, including transfers, promotions, and new hires of Azaza Inc.</p>
<h4><em>Probationary period</em></h4>
<p>The purpose of the probationary period is to provide orientation, guidance, on-the-job training, and coaching to the new employee, allowing them the opportunity to learn and fulfil the requirements of their new position. This period is also the final and critical phase of the selection process that will provide the hiring supervisor/manager the opportunity to evaluate the hiring decision. </p>
<p>To do this effectively, the supervisor/manager will be required to regularly monitor, measure and review the new employee's level of performance during the probationary period.  During this time, the new employee will be evaluating and adjusting to his/her new position and work environment to determine if expectations are being met and assessing his/her overall fit to the organization and its mission, and Committable Core values. </p>
</div>
<h3>Policy Application</h3>
<div>
<h4><em>Length of probation</em></h4>
<p>As a final test of employability, in positions of original appointment, promotion, or transfer to a class that has different qualifications, a probationary period of six (6) months shall be required. During this period, the employee has no right to expect continued employment in that position and employment can be terminated at any time. Employment beyond the probationary period is contingent upon a satisfactory evaluation of the employee's performance.</p>
<h4><em>Promotion or Transfer</em></h4>
<p>If an employee is promoted or transferred to a new position, the appropriate probationary period and review is again normally required. An employee does not have the option of returning to his/her former job if the new position does not work out satisfactorily nor can the Company guarantee another position. </p>
</div>
<h3>Probationary Evaluations</h3>
<div>
<p>During the probationary period the employee's performance is observed closely and their work reviewed frequently. Three Probationary Evaluation Reports must be completed and submitted to the Human Resources during the probation period.</p>
<p>At the end of the probation period, and subject to a satisfactory report by Management, employees will be notified in writing that they have successfully completed their probationary period.  Ongoing permanent employment is given only when the employee satisfactorily completes their probation. </p> 
<h4><em>Procedure</em></h4>
<ol><li>Give informal and formal appraisal during the probation period.</li>
<li>At the end of the probation period, complete a final probation appraisal and advise the employee of the result.</li>
</ol>
<h4><em>Five-month Evaluation</em></h4>
<p>The first report should take place shortly before the end of the first five months of employment. These performance evaluations will take into account the employee's ability to carry through work assignments, his or her record of punctuality and attendance, level of cooperation and teamwork, and general aptitude for successful performance of the job.  Management should review the evaluation with the employee and discuss the areas that need improvement thoroughly.  Those employees who demonstrate unsatisfactory performance within the first two (5) months of the probationary period may be terminated at the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<h4><em>Six-Month Evaluation</em></h4>
<p>The six month evaluation will be completed at the beginning of the six month of employment. The performance criteria for this evaluation are the same as for the five-month evaluation. Employees who successfully complete the probationary period will be considered regular full-time employees with all the rights and privileges thereof. Those employees who continue to demonstrate poor performance will be terminated at or before the end of the six-month probationary period.</p>
<h4><em>Extension of probationary period</em></h4>
<p>If Management requires some additional time to make a final determination about the fitness of the probationary employee for the job, Management may request an extension of the probationary period.  Such extension may not exceed three months.  At the end of the period a final determination about the continued employment of the probationary employee will be made.</p>
<p>Supervisors wishing to request an extension of probation should contact Human Resources at least two weeks before the employee's probationary period is to expire.  He/she will be asked to provide information about the specific areas in which the employee must improve in order to be eligible for continued employment.</p>
<h4><em>Notification of Successful Completion of Probation</em></h4>
<p>When Human Resources receives a recommendation for continued employment from the probationary employee's Supervisor, a notice will be sent to the employee informing them that they have successfully completed their probationary period. The achievement of the six month anniversary date does not automatically signal the end of the probationary period. Normally, the notice will be sent to the employee immediately following the end of the first three months of employment. An employee will be considered to be on probation until such time as notified otherwise by Human Resources.</p>
<h4><em>Change of status</em></h4>
<p>An employee cannot change from a probationary status to regular employment status unless his/her probationary review shows an acceptable assessment.</p>
</div>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<div>
<p>Azaza provides benefits, including various types of performance incentive plans, and a generous number of paid holidays and vacation days.</p> 
</div>
<h3>Eligibility</h3>
<div>
<p>Full time regular employees are eligible for the benefits programs (including , provided they have been with the company for at least a 3-month period or have successfully passed their probationary period.</p>
</div>
<h3>Termination</h3>
<div>
<p>The employee's performance shall be periodically assessed during the probationary period and the results discussed with her\him. If the employee's performance is unsatisfactory, employment may be terminated, in writing, during or before the end of the probationary period, subject to applicable statute.</p>
<p>Human Resources must be notified two (2) weeks before the end of the probationary period when the supervisor/manager suspects that a termination recommendation will be proposed.</p>

<ol><li><strong>Direct discrimination</strong> occurs when someone is treated unfavourably because of a personal characteristic.</li>
<li><strong>Indirect Discrimination</strong> occurs when a rule seems neutral, but has a discriminatory impact on certain people. For example a minimum height requirement of 6 foot for a particular job might be applied equally to men and women, but would indirectly discriminate on the basis of sex, as women tend to be shorter than men.</li>
<li><strong>Sexual Harassment</strong> includes unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in circumstances in which it could reasonably be expected to make a person feel offended, humiliated or intimidated a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated that the person harassed would be offended, humiliated or intimidated.</li>
<li><strong>Workplace Bullying</strong> may include behaviour that is directed toward an employee, or group of employees, that creates a risk to health and safety e.g. physical and/or verbal abuse, excluding or isolating individuals; or giving impossible tasks.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>Any employee found to have contravened this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include dismissal as outlined in the complaint procedure below.</p>

<div>
<p>If you believe you are being, or have been, discriminated against, sexually harassed or bullied, you should follow this procedure.
<ol><li>Tell the offender the behaviour is offensive, unwelcome, and against business policy and should stop (only if you feel comfortable enough to approach them directly, otherwise speak to management). Keep a written record of the incident(s).</li>
<li>If the unwelcome behaviour continues, contact your supervisor or manager for support.</li>
<li>If this is inappropriate, you feel uncomfortable, or the behaviour persists, contact another relevant senior manager.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>Employees should feel confident that any complaint they make is to be treated as confidential as far as possible.</p>
</div>

<ul><li>act promptly</li>
<li>maintain confidentiality</li>
<li>pass any notes on to the manager's manager</li></ul>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>If an investigation is requested or is appropriate, follow the next procedure.</p>

Make it clear they do not have to answer any questions, however, the manager will still make a decision regardless.</li>
<li>Listen carefully and record details.</li>
<li>Ensure confidentiality, minimise disclosure.</li>
<li>Decide on appropriate action based on investigation and evidence collected.</li>
<li>Check to ensure the action meets the needs of the complainant and Azaza Inc.</li>

<!-- PREGNANCY AT WORK -->
<div class="box-bottom">
<h2>PREGNANCY AT WORK</h2>
<div id="accordion7">
<h3>Advising of pregnancy</h3>
<div>
<p>Azaza encourages employees to inform their manager of their pregnancy as soon as possible. However, we respect that an employee may not wish to advise us of her pregnancy earlier than the minimum notice period.</p>
<p>We also respect an employee's wishes regarding when it is appropriate to tell colleagues about the pregnancy.</p>
<p><em>See the Parental leave policy on page 32</em> about requirements for taking unpaid parental leave, including notice periods.</p>
</div>
<h3>Working until the birth</h3>
<div>
<p>A pregnant employee may work until the expected date of birth of her child. If she wishes to continue working in the last six weeks of her pregnancy she may be requested to provide a medical certificate within seven days confirming she is fit to work.</p>
<p>If the medical certificate indicates the employee is not fit for work, she may be required to start parental leave or take a period of unpaid leave as soon as practicable. (<em>See the Parental leave policy on page 32</em>)</p>
</div>
<h3>Return to work</h3>
<div>
<p>If the employee has agreed to contact during leave, then towards the end of the leave period, the manager should confirm the employee's intention to return on the agreed date.</p>
<p>An employee must provide four weeks notice if they want to extend their leave beyond the return date that was initially advised (<em>see the Parental leave policy on page 20</em>)</p>
<p>The employee on parental leave has the right to return to the job they held prior to going on leave, including any promotion.  If that position no longer exists, the employee will be given whichever other available position is nearest in status and remuneration to the position they held prior to going on leave.</p>
<p>If the pre-parental leave position no longer exists, Azaza will follow its redeployment and redundancy procedures to determine if a suitable alternative position is available.</p>

</p>
<p>Employees who are requested to work during a paid holiday will receive holiday pay plus regular pay.</p>
</div>
<h3>Vacation leave policy</h3>
<div>
<p>Vacation pay is the employee's regular rate of pay, excluding overtime or holiday premiums. Each full time employee is entitled to eight (8) days Vacation leave a year (pro-rata for part-time). Leave entitlements are calculated from the date they started work.  This is not  accumulative and will expire within one (1) year. </p>
<h4><em>Scheduling Vacations</em></h4>
<p>Azaza, Inc. will attempt to grant all employees vacation at the time they desire to take it. However, Azaza must maintain adequate staffing at all times. Therefore, vacations must be scheduled in advance and with prior written approval.  Applications for vacation leave need to be lodged four (4) weeks in advance.</p>
<p>Where conflicts develop, they will be resolved as fairly as possible. Preference will be given to the more senior employee, the employee who can demonstrate the greater need for vacation at the conflicting time or the employee who makes the earliest request.</p>
<p>Vacation time may be taken in increments of one full day but in all cases must be prescheduled and preapproved. Azaza, Inc. does not provide paid vacation time for part-time employees.</p>
</div>
<h3>Personal (sick) leave policy</h3>
<div>
<p>An employee is entitled to 7 days of personal leave every 12 months. An employee should notify his/her supervisor/manager as soon as possible if they are unable to attend work due to illness or injury. It is required that the employee call or text Workforce to formally inform Management of his/her absence one (1) hour before the start of shift.  Management, at its discretion, may request evidence such as a medical certificate within 24 hours of reporting back to work, showing that the employee was entitled to take personal leave during the relevant period.  Sick Leaves/Personal Leaves are cash convertible if unused.</p>

<h4><em>Pay for Illness</em></h4>
<p>Employees will become eligible to participate in the paid time for illness program as follows:
<ul><li>if employed prior to July 1, employees will be allowed up to 7 days in the current year</li>
<li>if employed between July 1 and December 31, employees will be allowed up to 3 days in the current year.</li></ul></p>
<h4><em>Pay and benefits during sick leave </em></h4>
<p>Illness pay will be based on a regular eight-hour day at straight time and at the employee's base rate.  Sundays, daily overtime hours, paid holidays, and paid vacation time are excluded as time for which payment will be made under this program.</p>
<h4><em>Certification of illness </em></h4>
<p>Certification of illness by a physician will normally be required to qualify for payment under this program.</p>
<h4><em>Effect on performance</em></h4>
<p>While the company pays you for authorized sick days, we expect you to be honest with us in taking days off only when you are actually ill.  Any abuse of this benefit will be taken into account in evaluations of your performance.  The company reserves the right to require a statement from your doctor.</p>
<h4><em>At termination</em></h4>
<p>When termination of employment occurs, no payment for sick leave will be made.</p>

</div>
<h3>Carer's leave policy</h3>
<div>
<p>Carer's leave is available to an employee for the care or support of an ill family or household member or if an unexpected emergency affects a family or household member. It is typically part of personal (sick) leave and is dealt with similarly to above.</p>
</div>
<h3>Bereavement Leave Policy</h3>
<div>
<h4><em>Salaried Employees</em></h4>
<p>The purpose of funeral leave is to provide you with time to attend the funeral of a member of your family and to handle personal affairs without disrupting your income.  Only permanent full-time employees are eligible for funeral leave benefits, and the benefits become effective after you complete your training and adjustment period.</p>
<h4><em>Time allowed:</em></h4>
<p>You may be granted up to a three-day leave (three consecutive working days) with pay in the event of the death of an immediate family member.</p>
<h4><em>Definition of immediate family member:</em></h4>
<p>The term immediate family member is defined as:
<ul><li>Brother</li>
<li>Child</li>
<li>Father</li>
<li>Father-in-law</li>
<li>Husband</li>
<li>Mother</li>
<li>Mother-in-law</li>
<li>Sister</li>
<li>Stepbrother</li>
<li>Stepchild</li>

<p>If you are not eligible for funeral leave with pay, you may be given time off without pay in case of a death in the family.  Time off without pay may be arranged to attend the funeral of a close friend.  Each day off will be counted as an absence without pay.</p>
</div>
<h3>Maternity Leave</h3>
<div>
<p>A female member of the Social Security System (SSS) who has paid at least 3 monthly contributions in the twelve-month period immediately preceding the semester of her childbirth or miscarriage shall be paid a daily maternity benefit equivalent to 100% of her average daily salary. The benefit is for 60 days for normal delivery and 78 days for caesarian delivery for the first four deliveries and miscarriages.</p>
<p>After birth the parent with responsibility for the care of the child is entitled to unpaid parental leave. Employees who are pregnant may commence leave up to two weeks before the expected date.</p>
<p>Employees may request to extend their leave on account of illness arising out of the pregnancy, delivery, abortion or miscarriage, which renders the employee unfit to work.  Such request is to be submitted in writing at least four weeks before the end of the original 60 or 78 days unpaid parental leave.</p>
<p>Azaza Inc. will respond in writing and may refuse only on reasonable business grounds. The written response will include details if the request is refused.</p>
<h4><em>Leave for pregnancy related illness</em></h4>
<p>If an employee is ill during her pregnancy, she may access her ordinary sick leave entitlements, including any accrued leave.</p>
<p>Azaza Inc. respects that some employees do not want any contact while on leave, and others do. The manager should discuss with the employee what sort of communication the employee would like while on leave, and record this agreement.</p>
<p>An employee can resign while on parental leave but they must give the required notice of resignation as set out in the Termination and Resignation Policy on page 44.</p>
<p>Employees should not undertake any activity during leave which is inconsistent with the employment contract, including other employment and they should remain responsible for the care of the child. </p>
<p>The employee's position may be filled on a temporary basis while they are on leave. Azaza Inc. will notify the replacement employee that their employment in this role is temporary and that the pregnant employee has the right to return to the position. </p>
</div>
<h3>Paternity Leave</h3>
<div>
<p>The law provides for paternity leave of 7 days with full pay to all married male employees in the private and public sectors. It is only available for the first four (4) deliveries of the legitimate spouse with whom the employee is cohabiting.</p>

<!-- PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT -->
<div class="box-bottom">
<h2>PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT</h2>
<div id="accordion9">
<h3>Policy</h3>
<div>
<p>The fundamental goal of performance management is to promote and improve employee effectiveness. It is a continuous process where supervisors and employees work together to plan, monitor and review an employee's work objectives or goals and his or her overall contribution to the organization.</p>
<p>Performance management is the continuous process of setting objectives, assessing progress and providing on-going coaching and feedback to ensure that employees are meeting their objectives and career goals.</p>
</div>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<div>
<p><ol><li>At least one month in advance of the formal evaluation due date, supervisors will be notified that employees are due for review.  This should allow adequate time for compiling performance information, completing the evaluation form, and setting an appointment with an employee.</li>
<li>The supervisor and employee will meet and openly and constructively discuss performance over the period.</li>
<li>The supervisor and the employee will then establish objectives for the following evaluation period</li>
<li>Training and development will be considered as part of the process.</li>
<li>Both the manager and employee may retain a copy of the completed Performance Evaluation.</li>
<li>Outside of this formal process, employees are encouraged to raise any issues they have when they arise.</li></ol></p>
</div>
<h3>Continuous coaching</h3>
<div>
<p>Performance management includes coaching employees to address concerns and issues related to performance so that there is a positive contribution to the organization. Coaching means providing direction, guidance, and support as required on assigned activities and tasks.</p> 
<p>Supervisors will need to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of employees and work with employees to identify opportunities and methods to maximize strengths and improve weak areas. Supervisors will give the employee feedback and reassurance while he/she practices new skills.</p>
</div>
<h3>Providing feedback</h3>
<div>
<p>Positive feedback involves telling someone about good performance. Feedback needs to be timely, specific and frequent.  Recognition for effective performance is a powerful motivator.</p>
<p>Constructive feedback alerts an individual to an area in which performance could improve. It is descriptive and should always be directed to the action, not the person. The main purpose of constructive feedback is to help people understand where they stand in relation to expected and/or productive job and workplace behavior.</p>
<p>If an employee is not meeting performance expectations, managers will provide constructive and honest feedback. It's important to do this when an issue first arises - before it escalates into a significant problem. </p>
</div>
<h3>Agreeing on an action plan</h3>
<div>
<p><ul><li>The supervisor will ask an employee for their suggestions for addressing the issue and offer their suggestions if necessary</li>
<li> supervisor and employee need to agree on a specific plan of action: <strong>including what the employee will do, how they plan to do it and within what time period</strong></li>
<li>Document the action plan and attach to employees performance evaluation file/form</li>
<li>The supervisor will specify the consequences for the employee if the performance issue is not resolved</li></ul></p>
</div>
<h3>Schedule for Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>Performance evaluations are scheduled as follows: 
<ul><li>Six months after last probationary evaluation</li>
<li>Quarterly thereafter</li></ul></p>
<p>This schedule can be started over again at the time of promotion, or a new schedule can be set.  Increases may occur at the time of each evaluation, but they are not guaranteed.  No performance-related increase can happen without a completed appraisal.</p>

Should such improvement processes be unsuccessful in improving an employee's performance, Azaza, Inc. may decide to end an employee's employment. Depending on the circumstances, performance improvement action may include verbal or written warnings, counselling or retraining.</p>
<p>Azaza, Inc. requires a minimum standard of conduct and performance which will be made clear to employees in performance appraisals and in the Azaza COD. If an employee does not meet this standard, Azaza, Inc. will take appropriate corrective action. Formal performance improvement procedures will generally only start when other corrective action fails.</p>
<p>If an employee deliberately breaches business policy or procedure, or engages in misconduct, Azaza Inc. may start improvement procedures, or, in cases of serious misconduct or breach of policy, may dismiss an employee.</p>
<p>Each employee must understand their responsibilities, be counselled and given the opportunity to reach the standards expected of them. Azaza, Inc. will give an employee the opportunity to defend themselves before management takes further action.</p>
</div>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<div>
<p><ol><li>Azaza, Inc. will advise the employee of any shortfall in their performance, and give them an opportunity to respond.</li>
<li>Once they respond, the manager will consider their response and decide if performance improvement action should be taken.  Azaza, Inc. will provide support such as training where appropriate.</li>
<li>If the employee is given a verbal warning, the supervisor should make a note of it, date it and sign it.</li>
<li>The manager will advise the employee in clear terms what they see as the performance problem or the unacceptable conduct. To highlight the deficiency they should use specific examples, and refer to the correct policy or procedure.</li>
<li>The supervisor will allow the employee to respond before making a decision and consider the employee's responses.</li> 
<li>The supervisor will decide if more action is needed.</li>
<li>If a written warning is to follow, the supervisor is to:
  <ul><li>document it and give the employee a copy</li>
  <li>give the employee the opportunity to sign the warning</li>
  <li>keep a copy on file</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The warning must clearly define:
  <ul><li>the deficiency</li>
  <li>an explanation of the expected standard</li>
  <li>by when the employee needs to achieve it</li>
  <li>consequences of failing to improve</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The supervisor concerned will keep a record of all meetings, training and/or coaching given and a summary of discussions, and put a copy on the employee's personnel file. This should include date, location and time of discussion.</li>
<li>They will continue to support the employee and note the support they give, for example, training or counselling.</li>
<li>If the employee's performance or conduct doesn't improve, the supervisor will give the employee a final written warning and follow steps 4-10 above. This document needs to warn the employee in clear terms Azaza, Inc. will terminate their employment if there is not enough improvement, and a sustained improvement in, their performance.</li></ol></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: some circumstances justify going straight to a second or final warning. </p>
</div>

<p>Summary (instant) dismissal for gross or very serious misconduct is possible (depending on the facts involved).</p>
<h4><em>Procedure</em></h4>

<h2>DISCIPLINE</h2>
<div id="accordion11">
<h3>Policy</h3>
<div>
<p>The Company practices progressive discipline when appropriate. Progressive discipline is a process in which disciplinary action is taken in degrees of increasing severity. The action taken will depend on the degree and the circumstances of the violation. An employee who fails to adequately perform assigned duties or who violates established policies will be subject to discipline.</p>
</div>

</div>
<h3>Types of Actions</h3>
<div>
<p>The five type of disciplinary actions recognized by the University fall into two general categories, reprimands/warnings and adverse actions.</p>
<h4><em>Reprimands/Warnings</em></h4>
<p>A reprimand is a formal means of communicating to the employee a warning that a problem exists and that it must be corrected. There are two (2) degrees of formality, the oral reprimand and the written reprimand.</p>
<h4><em>Oral Reprimand</em></h4>
<p>An oral reprimand is a verbal explanation by a supervisor to an employee, that he or she is being reprimanded. The supervisor should explain the problem and what must be done to correct it. In some cases, no formal record of the reprimand is appended to the employee's personnel file. The supervisor must keep a record of the oral warning.</p>
<h4><em>Written Reprimand</em></h4>
<p>In the written reprimand, the employee will receive a written statement describing the problem and what must be done to correct it. If the employee is at work the written statement will be given to the employee during a private interview. If it is necessary to deliver the reprimand to the employee outside of the workplace, it must be sent by certified mail. A copy of the written reprimand will be placed in the employee's personnel file.</p>
<h4><em>Adverse Actions</em></h4>
<p>An adverse action is an action taken by the supervisor or manager, for cause, that results in a disciplinary suspension without pay, disciplinary demotion, or disciplinary dismissal.</p>
<h4><em>Suspension Without Pay</em></h4>
<p>An employee may be suspended without pay for a violation of accepted policies governing performance and conduct. The suspension without pay shall not exceed thirty (30) days.</p>
<h4><em>Dismissal</em></h4>
Disciplinary Demotion
<p>An employee may be demoted from one pay grade to a lower grade for disciplinary reasons, if a lower position is open and if the employee is qualified to perform the work at the lower position. A disciplinary demotion may or may not include a decrease in salary.</p>
<h4><em>Dismissal</em></h4>
<p>An employee may be dismissed for disciplinary reasons when progressive disciplinary actions have failed to solve the problem, or when the nature of the employee's infraction warrants such actions, or when it is necessary to remove the employee from the work place immediately and/or permanently.</p>
</div>
<h3>Notice of Adverse Action</h3>
<div>
<p>After consultation with Human Resources, Management or their respective designee will give the employee written notification of the impending adverse action. The notification will include the following:
<ol><li>the effective date of the action,</li>
<li>the specific charges or reasons for the action,</li>
<li>notice of the employees right to appeal,</li>
<li>deadline for filing an appeal</li></ol>

<!-- CONFLICT OF INTEREST -->
<div class="box-bottom">
<h2>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</h2>
<div id="accordion12">
<h3>Policy</h3>
<div>
<p>Conflict of interest arises whenever the personal, professional or business interests of an employee are potentially at odds with the best interests of Azaza, Inc.</p>
<p>All employees are required to act in good faith towards Azaza, Inc.. Employees need to be aware of the potential for a conflict of interest to arise and should always act in the best interests of Azaza, Inc.</p>
 
<p>As individuals, employees may have private interests that from time to time conflict, or appear to conflict, with their employment with Azaza, Inc. Employees should aim to avoid being put in a situation where there may be a conflict between the interests of Azaza, Inc. and their own personal or professional interests, or those of relatives or friends. Where such a conflict occurs (or is perceived to occur), the interests of Azaza, Inc. will be balanced against the interests of the staff member and, unless exceptional circumstances exist, resolved in favour of Azaza, Inc.</p> 
<p>It is impossible to define all potential areas of conflict of interest. If an employee is in doubt if a conflict exists, they should raise the matter with their manager.</p>
</div>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<div>
<p>Employees must:
<ul><li>declare any potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interest that exist on becoming employed by Azaza, Inc. to management</li>
<li>declare any potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interest that arise or are likely to arise during employment by Azaza, Inc. to management</li>
<li>avoid being placed in a situation where there is potential, actual or perceived conflict of interest if at all possible</li></ul></p>
<p>If an employee declares such an interest, Azaza, Inc. will review the potential areas of conflict with the employee and mutually agree on practical arrangements to resolve the situation.</p>
<p>Employees must disclose any other employment that might cause a conflict of interest with Azaza, Inc. to their manager. Where there are external involvements that do not represent a conflict of interest, these must not affect performance or attendance whilst working at Azaza, Inc.

<p>Employees must not set up or engage in private business or undertake other employment in direct or indirect competition with Azaza, Inc. using knowledge and/or materials gained during the course of employment with Azaza, Inc. </p>
<p>Engaging in other business interests during work hours will result in strong performance improvement action.</p>
<p>Failure to declare a potential, actual or perceived conflict of interest or to take remedial action agreed with Azaza, Inc., in a timely manner, may result in performance improvement proceedings including dismissal.</p>
</div>
<h3>Outside Employment Policy</h3>
<div>
<p>As a general rule, employees may not obtain outside employment that creates interference with their primary job or that creates a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Secondary jobs are permissible only with Management's written approval and only if the employee can continue to perform their normal duties and work requirement within the regularly scheduled workweek.  Work assignments and schedules will not be modified to allow the employee to perform duties or services that are not related to Azaza.</p>  
<p>Azaza Inc. has no objection to an employee holding outside employment so long as they can meet performance standards of their job with Azaza Inc.</p> 
<p>Unless otherwise agreed to, employment with Azaza is deemed to be full time.  Azaza Inc. recognizes that an employee may be justified under certain circumstances to accept casual outside employment to be performed after working hours if no conflict with Azaza Inc.'s interest is involved.</p>
<p>Employees shall not engage in or accept any activity, business, or employment during or after working hours that could be considered in conflict with Azaza's interests or diminish the ability of the employee to render to the company the full, loyal and undivided service which is contemplated in his or her employment by Azaza Inc.</p>
<p>Should an employee wish to obtain outside employment, it should be discussed with the direct supervisor/manager prior to accepting the job.</p>

</ul></p>
<p>This list is intended to be representative of the types of activities that may result in disciplinary action.  It is not exhaustive, and is not intended to be comprehensive.  Please refer to Azaza COD for infractions and subsequent sanctions.</p>
<p>Non-probationary employees who are terminated under this provision are entitled to due process and may appeal their dismissal according to the following guidelines and procedures:</p>
<strong>Notice of Termination</strong>
<p>After consultation with Human Resources, Management or their respective designee will give the employee written notification of the impending dismissal. The notification will include the following:
<ol class="termination"><li>The effective date of the action,</li>
<li>The specific charges or reasons for the action,</li>
<li>Notice of the employee's right to appeal,</li>
<li>The deadline for filing an appeal.</li></ol></p>
<h4>Non-Renewal of Contract</h4>
<p>Upon the recommendation of Chief Executive Officer, Management may approve the renewal of any employment contract. Any contract not renewed shall expire on its end date. The non-renewal of a contract is not a termination for cause and,
therefore, the employee does not have to be informed of the cause for non-renewal. Contract employees have no right to expect continued employment beyond the end date of their current contracts.</p>
<h4>Reduction-in-Force</h4>
<p>A reduction-in-force may be necessary when a position or group of positions must be closed because of lack of work or funds. Employees who are separated in a reduction-in-force will receive preference in rehiring should a position for which they are qualified open within one year.</p>
<h4>Job Abandonment</h4>
<p>Employees who are absent from work for five (5) or more consecutive days without authorized leave will be considered as having voluntarily abandoned their jobs. Azaza, Inc. will officially terminate such employee at the end of the fifth day of such unauthorized absence. Employees who are terminated under such circumstances are not eligible to be rehired.</p>
<h4>Discipline Other Than Termination</h4>
<p>All employees are expected to meet Azaza, Inc.'s standards of work performance.  Work performance encompasses many factors, including attendance, punctuality, personal conduct, job proficiency and general compliance with the Company's policies and procedures.</p>
<p>If an employee does not meet these standards, the Company may, under appropriate circumstances, take corrective action, other than immediate dismissal.</p>
<p>The intent of corrective action is to formally document problems while providing the employee with a reasonable time within which to improve performance.  The process is designed to encourage development by providing employees with guidance in areas that need improvement such as poor work performance, attendance problems, personal conduct, general compliance with the Company's policies and procedures and/or other disciplinary problems.(Please refer to page 39)</p>
